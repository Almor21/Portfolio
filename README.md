# Personal Portfolio

Personal web portfolio showcasing my best projects and web development skills. Built with a modern and efficient tech stack including **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**, this site offers a **minimalist**, **dynamic** and **engaging user experience**, with a **responsive design** that adapts to any device.

The design, entirely created from scratch, focuses on providing an innovative and elegant user experience. I implemented **Zustand** to efficiently manage global state, optimizing the data flow throughout the application. Additionally, I integrated **Framer Motion** to add **dynamic animations**, giving the site a visually appealing and **engaging feel**.

The portfolio also includes a small backend integration through **API routes** that automate the retrieval and updating of data regarding the technologies I use and the projects I have developed, **facilitating future scalability**.
